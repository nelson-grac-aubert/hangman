# Hangman
The popular word game made into a simple app to play on your computer!

## Requirements 

Python 3, using the PyGame library
We are trying to build a .exe app!

## Features 
- Play a game of hangman with a word picked randomly from a list of french words
- Pick your difficulty that will affect the lenght of words, the amount of letters, and your final score
- Consult the list of possible words (we advise against it if you're a player, as it makes the game easier), add and delete words as you please
- Consult the score board
- Mute/unmute the music and the chalk sound on click / letter input. 

## Dev difficulties 
- Game algorithm
- Handling of assets, especially for the .exe build

## Possible Improvements 
- Modify the difficulty settings to make them more engaging : 
  - Add uncommon letters to harder difficulties
  - Add a timer
  - Build a "hint" feature for easy difficulty
- Rework the score system : clutch bonus if 1 life left, take timer into account...
- Add a save/resume game feature
Improve aesthetics
Audio : add better music, SFX, win chime, defeat chime.
